# apple shorcuts

This repository contains useful shortcuts for Apple devices, which simplify and optimise user flows.

Available shortcuts:
** Edit and Call - **Edit and Call - Apple seems to have introduced a restriction for all users when it comes to editing a copied number before dialling in the Phone application.**

Some users claim that it used to be possible to edit the prefix of the number. However, this functionality has become available in iOS 18.4. It is still possible in iOS Beta 18.5 (22F5042g) by long-pressing the number and sliding the finger.

The ** Edit and Call ** shortcut makes it possible to edit the number by retrieving clipboard content or sharing content to it.
